# focus.
A minimalistic, productivity oriented text editor using pomodoro.

# the concept
We set out to create a simple word processor that would help users manage their time and get the most work done. The first objective was to minimize distractions. Focus features a clean, minimalistic interface, to avoid a cluttered workspace. The second objective was to maximize the productivity, using the pomodoro technique. This is a time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. Working with the pomodoro technique, the user breaks down their work sessions into intervals, (traditionally 25 minutes in length) and takes short breaks in between. Starting with these 2 core concepts, focus was born.
